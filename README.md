linux-steam-integration
-----------------------

Linux Steam* Integration is a helper system to make the Steam Client and Steam
games run better on Linux. In a nutshell, LSI automatically applies various workarounds
to get games working, and fixes long standing bugs in both games and the client.

In many cases this will involve controlling which libraries are allowed to be used
at any given time, and these libraries may be overriden for any of the following
reasons:

 - Security
 - Compatibility
 - Performance

Additionally we apply dynamic workarounds to fix some filesystem path related bugs in Linux
ports (or even shader workarounds for Ark) through our redirect module.

With LSI, you don't need to worry any more about manually mangling your Steam installation
just to make the open source drivers work, or manually creating links and installing
unsupported libraries. LSI is designed to take care of all of this for you.

Note that LSI will not modify your Steam installation, and instead makes use of two
modules, `liblsi-redirect.so` and `liblsi-intercept.so`, to dynamically apply all of the
workarounds at runtime, which in turn is set up by the main LSI `shim` binary.

For a more in depth view of what LSI is, and how to integrate it into your distribution,
please check the [technical README document](https://github.com/solus-project/linux-steam-integration/blob/master/TECHNICAL.md).

Do note that we intend to remove the need for distributions to integrate LSI in the near future, by providing
the LSI system as a [snap](https://snapcraft.io/) package for all supported distributions.
